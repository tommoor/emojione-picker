# Emoji Picker

A friendly Emoji picker for Emojione written as a React component. It looks a little something like this, but is easily customized:

## Installation

`npm install emojione-picker`


## Usage

The npm module includes a pre-transpiled version of the picker so you don't need to run it through your JSX pipeline. Simply require the module like any other.

```javascript
var EmojiPicker = require('emojione-picker');

<EmojiPicker onChange={function(data){
  console.log("Emoji chosen", data);
}} />
```

The module also includes CSS at `css/picker.css` which you can copy and edit or ideally reference directly from within the node_modules directory. Let me know if you're using this in production - i'd love to see it in action!

### Filtering

You can manually pass in a search term as a component prop to filter which emoji's are displayed by default, for example:

```javascript
<EmojiPicker search="smile" />
```

Or allow the user to search by passing a boolean true, this will enable a search input within the picker:

```javascript
<EmojiPicker search={true} />
```

### Customize Categories

You can easily customize the category icons by passing in alternatives to the component constructor. The emoji strings come from the shortname value in strategy.js

```javascript
var categories = {
  people: {
    title:'People',
    emoji: 'smile'
  },
  nature: {
    title: 'Nature',
    emoji: 'mouse'
  },
  food: {
    title: 'Food & Drink',
    emoji: 'burger'
  }
}

<EmojiPicker categories={categories} />
```

### Spritesheets

You can make the picker use a spritesheet, however this requires a little extra work. Emojione settings can
be passed into the Picker component as below. [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione#extras) to load the correct spritesheets into your page.

```javascript
var settings = {
  imageType: 'png',
  sprites: true
};
<EmojiPicker categories={categories} emojione={settings} />
```

### Exclude emojis

You can manually pass a exclude emojis array as a component prop to exclude emojis, then excluded emojis are displayed, for example:

```javascript
<EmojiPicker excludeEmojis={excludeEmojis} />
```

## Development

```
npm install
npm run watch
```
